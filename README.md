Welcome to a Simple Snake, a game working on a FPGA board.

AS easy as it suggests :

And it's done ! Welcome to Snake FPGA edition.

You will start at the top left corner as a dark green square. At the top right, 
you will see a score counter which goes from 0 to 5.

The red circle is the apple you eat to get a point.

When you eat the apple, it takes a second to update the game and for the apple to appear in another cell.

This project was made using the ALTERA DE10-Lite FPGA board.
